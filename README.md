Hi, I'm Stiletto 👋

Digital Architect blending Next.js, AI/Cybersecurity, and cinematic visual storytelling.

I’m a 19-year-old digital architect based in Kenya 🇰🇪.

I am deeply passionate about modern web engineering, currently building a strong foundation in Next.js, cloud services, and scalable front-end architectures.

Alongside development, I’m expanding my expertise in AI/LLM integration and Cybersecurity principles, ensuring that every application I build is intelligent, secure, and future-ready. I also create high-quality cinematic content, blending storytelling with visual precision.

For me, every day is an opportunity to grow, refine my craft, and deliver meaningful digital experiences.
